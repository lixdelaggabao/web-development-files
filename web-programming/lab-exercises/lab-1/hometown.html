De Legazpi thought to use it against Muslim warriors. However, as time passed by, other colonizers had used it for other reasons. When Americans occupied Cebu, their soldiers used this as their residence. Also, Americans educated Cebuanos in this fort. Further, during the Japanese colonization,  Japanese also used the fort as a barrack, a prisoner and a hospital. The historicity of this smallest-oldest fort in the country is undeniable.</p>
